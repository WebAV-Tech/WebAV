### WebAV Performance

Please refer to [WebCodecs Performance and Optimization Strategies](https://hughfenghen.github.io/posts/2024/07/27/webcodecs-performance-benchmark/).

Summary: Performance on some devices is close to native solutions, but there is still a slight gap overall, with further optimizations planned.

### Does it support Vue or other UI frameworks?

Yes, it does.

WebAV is an audio-video processing library and is independent of any UI framework.  
The UI in the DEMO is developed using React, but if you're using another UI framework, just focus on the WebAV API.
